ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a passionate and responsible Full Stack Developer with a strong interest in .NET technologies, web development, and front-end design.

Iâ€™m currently in my final year of the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Multimedia Technology at the University of Costa Rica, where Iâ€™ve worked on several academic projects that demonstrate my creativity, teamwork, and commitment to learning.


University Projects:

It allows administrative staff to register guests, manage room availability, and efficiently manage reservations through a streamlined interface. The system streamlines the internal operations of small and medium-sized hotel businesses. http://sitiehotelbeachsa.somee.com/

API Web HotelBeachSA (.NET, C#, .NET MVC): 
A web API was created using .NET and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to support platform operations. This API allows the system to save, update, and retrieve data related to customers, packages, and reservations. The MVC structure facilitates the separation of responsibilities in the code, making it easier to maintain and scale. http://www.apiwebhotel.somee.com/Clientes/Listado - http://www.apiwebhotel.somee.com/Usuarios/Listado - http://www.apiwebhotel.somee.com/Reservas/Listado - http://www.apiwebhotel.somee.com/Paquetes/Listado
